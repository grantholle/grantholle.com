# The TEA Stack

Welcome to the shortest stack out there. This stack combines Tailwind CSS, Eleventy, and Alpine.js to make static site authoring easy and minimal!

There are some other goodies in here, but they change so often that it's probably not worth including here, just check the `package.json` file!

## Getting Started

Just run the usual commands and peep the `package.json` file to see the available scripts and packages.

For the lazy:

- `npm i` to build that big ol' `node_modules` folder
- `npm run dev` to boot up that dev server and start building
- `npm run build` when you're ready to build a production bundle

**Bonus**
`npm run build && npx serve dist` will boot up a local server of your production site!
